config APP_SMART_HEAPSIZE
  int "Heap section size"
  depends on APP_SMART
  default 0
  ---help---
    specify the requested heap size in bytes. Only requested if dynamic memory
    primitives are used (typically malloc())

config APP_SMART_STACKSIZE
  int "Stack size"
  depends on APP_SMART
  default 8192
  ---help---
    Specify the application stack size, in bytes. By default, set to 8192
    (i.e. 8k). Depending on the number of slots required, and the usage,
    the stack can be bigger or smaller.


config APP_SMART_PRIO
  int "Smart application priority"
  default 1
  ---help---
    Set the Smart application priority (between 0 (the lower) to 255 (the higher)).
    Only used when the RMA scheduler is executed. In this later case:
    - Tasks of higher priority are executed while they are runnable
    - Tasks of same priority are executed respecting a Round-Robin scheduling
    When using priority and RMA scheduling, please take care to yield()
    as much as possible to avoid deny of service to lower priority tasks

  depends on APP_SMART
  depends on STM32F4
  default y
  ---help---
    Say y if you want to use Backup SRAM for keybag storage (this is better for
    firmware security and hence put tu y as default).

    If 0, the application has no access to any HW cryp module.
    If 1, the application is able to use a HW cryp module configured
    by another application.
    If 2, the application is able to configure (inject keys) but can't
    use the crypt module (no IRQ handler).
    If 3, the application as a full, autonomous access to the HW cryp
    module

    default n
    ---help---
    If y, the application is able to request its main thread execution
    just after specific ISRs. This is done using the dev_irq_mode_t
    structure in device_t struct, using the IRQ_ISR_FORCE_MAINTHREAD value.
    If n, this field can't be set to this value.

config APP_SMART_PERM_TSK_FIPC

    bool "App is allowed to upgrade the firmware"
    default n
    ---help---
    If y, the application is able to map the embedded flash device in
    order to upgrade the overall firmware. This permission should
    be hosted by a task with no external access (USB, USART...)
